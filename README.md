# New Tab

A local-first browser new-tab dashboard built with WXT, React, and Effect.

## Development

Install dependencies with Bun:

```sh
bun install
```

Run the extension in Chrome/Chromium:

```sh
bun run dev
```

Run it in Firefox:

```sh
bun run dev:firefox
```

## Persistent Chrome extension ID

Chromium derives an extension ID from its manifest key. Generate this project's private key once to keep the same ID across local builds:

```sh
bun run generate-key
```

The script writes a gitignored `key.pem`, prints the derived extension ID, and prints the command to register the key as the `WXT_CHROME_KEY` GitHub Actions secret. Do not commit or share `key.pem`. Push builds on `init` require that secret and use it only for Chrome builds; pull-request builds do not receive it. Firefox continues to use the fixed Gecko ID in `wxt.config.ts` and does not use the Chrome key. Do not use `--force` unless you intend to change the Chrome extension ID.

## Checks and builds

```sh
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run check
bun run build
bun run zip
```

`build` and `zip` produce both Chromium and Firefox outputs. Use `build:chrome`, `build:firefox`, `zip:chrome`, or `zip:firefox` for one browser.

## Changesets

Create a release note for user-visible changes with:

```sh
bun run changeset
```

For a non-interactive changeset, use:

```sh
bun run changeset-add minor "Add dashboard search actions"
```
